# Dungeon Crawler - a LD 45 Compo Game by Rialgar
A simple Dungeon Crawler. The challenge lies in discovering the enemies stats. Each generated level should be possible, but you may need knowledge about the enemies you do not have yet. You can get an idea of an enemies strength by inspecting them with 'c'. Detailed instructions in the game itself.

Made in under 48 hours for the 45th Ludum Dare Game Making Competion (Compo).
